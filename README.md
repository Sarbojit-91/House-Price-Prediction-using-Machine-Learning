# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques in Python. By analyzing data such as lot size, location, house condition, and build year, the model helps generate price estimates to assist in real estate decision-making.


📂 Dataset
The dataset contains 13 features:

Id: Record identifier

MSSubClass: Type of dwelling

MSZoning: Zoning classification

LotArea: Lot size in sq ft

LotConfig: Lot configuration

BldgType: Type of dwelling

OverallCond: Overall condition of the house

YearBuilt: Year of original construction

YearRemodAdd: Year of remodeling

Exterior1st: Exterior covering material

BsmtFinSF2: Type 2 basement finished area (in sq ft)

TotalBsmtSF: Total basement area (in sq ft)

SalePrice: Target variable (house price)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization

Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
